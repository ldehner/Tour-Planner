## Unique feature
Our Unique feature is a service, which provides the current temperature and a verbal weather description of the starting point end destination of a tour. We are using the free version of the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get the live data. This API also provides a service that returns you the weather of a route, which we originally planned to use, but this service is only available in the highly paied version.
